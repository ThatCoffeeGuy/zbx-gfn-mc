## Disclamer

This was going to be just a private repository but after I wrote an installation guide for the chia dashboard, I decided to make it public.

 I am aware that this is nowhere near nice looking or practical - I might improve it over time.


## Prerequisites
assuming you're using Ubuntu 20.04:
- Latest Grafana
- Zabbix 5.0 LTS agent and server
- Java minecraft server


## Installation

### Under construction
